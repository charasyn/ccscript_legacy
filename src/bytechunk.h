// Changes for CCScript 2.0:
//
// Firstly, this class will be renamed to "String" to represent its place
// as one of CCScript 2.0's fundamental types.
//
// Beyond that, its interface will be changed somewhat: it will no longer
// support operations like SetBaseAddress(), which pertain to its now
// outmoded role as a close interactor with the underlying ROM data. It
// will also no longer have an internal "position".
//
// It will still have internal References, and what is more we will also
// add "Anchors," providing relative locations for References to be linked
// to. (This is necessary because in CCScript 2.0 it will often be the case
// that we evaluate a string mutator like "and" that needs internal jump
// codes before we actually know its location in the ROM.)
//
// The first immediate change, though, is the addition of an Append method,
// which allows one ByteChunk to be appended to another.
//
// We'll also need a Substring method, which returns a specified portion of
// the ByteChunk, with anchors and possibly truncated references. (This
// raises a question: what do we do when a substring slices out an anchor
// to which a reference in the remaining portion refers? Hrm. I can't think
// of any situation in which you'd want to be able to do that, and I also
// can't think of any reasonable way to recover from it. I think that should
// be an error case.)
